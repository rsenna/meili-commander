# Meili Commander


**Meili Commander** is a file management tool for macOS. Its dual-pane layout is inspired by Total Commander, and many of its keyboard shortcuts are borrowed from the Vim editor.


The Chinese word for “beautiful” is 美丽 — or *měilì* in Pinyin. **Meili Commander** is a fork of [_vCommander_](https://github.com/treblam/vCommander), originally created by [@treblam](https://github.com/treblam) from Shenzhen, China. I'm not Chinese, but I enjoy learning Mandarin, so *Meili* was chosen as a tribute to the original project and its creator.
